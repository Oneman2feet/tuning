# notes
With rare exceptions, the music must use only chords in the barbershop chord vocabulary.
Most characteristic is the major-minor seventh or dominant seventh chord, more often
called the barbershop seventh. It and the major triad are the most featured chords in
barbershop harmony. In addition, barbershop harmony uses the following chords: minor
triads, incomplete dominant ninths, minor sevenths, minor sixths, half-diminished
sevenths, diminished sevenths, major sevenths, major sixths, major chords with added
ninth, augmented triads, augmented dominant sevenths, diminished triads, and dominant
sevenths with flatted fifth. While brief and musically appropriate use of out of vocabulary
chords is allowable, this may result in a lower score due to diminished consonance.
